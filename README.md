# George Sanabria Interesting Article 
[Article]:  ( https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/ )by Joel Spolsky

This article is interesting to me as Spolsky goes into depth about what software abstractions are which include some programming languages or libraries. These abstractions are made to make life easier, an attempt to hide the complexity behind it however, it never truly succeeds. He brings up the concept of abstractions leak in which the issue that developers try to make easy, fall apart and reveal themselves leading to things going wrong. When an error occurs, developers are forced to fix the issue which defeats the purpose of abstractions. At the end, Spolsky brings up a great point claiming that although abstractions are not entirely bad, trusting them without knowing what they do will cause issues. Strong software engineers must be able to find a solution or workaround if the abstraction fails.
